Review: This thing used to sell for 600/- each set when it was first launched about 5 years ago. Im quite sure many purchased it for that price point too. Ofcourse if you are not selective about colour choices, then this is a steal deal.If one would notice, the models (from original older product pics of similar items) are all chinese /asian models. This is sadly not an India made product, its cheap BUT GOOD QUALITY chinese product.Many winter wear that is often sold on street side shops are also chinese products especially long coats and long jackets, just like these cap and muffler sets.It has synthetic wool, which is already super warm, and inner synthetic cruelty free fur lining, Overall very warm, might even feel too hot for light winters. Excellent quality, if you have a normal sized neck and arent too bulky or fatty person, this will fit just fine.It is just sad that India still cannot make cheap winter wear. Do not believe make in india tag if someone puts that on this, this is purely a chinese bulk sold item. However, product is very good.

Review: Although bought it before onset of winter and did not use it as yet, however, upon seeing the product I could feel that it may remain less warm.  At the same time I must say that it would be useful during lesser cold days and the throw away price really attracts.  Neck band also seems good
