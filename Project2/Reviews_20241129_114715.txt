Review: No more items sliding off the arm of your couch or recliner arms. Great addition and easy to fit on arms.  Spring loaded so it’s easy to attach.Clean with damp cloth, looks nice and it’s sturdy.

Review: We got a new sofa that has a chaise lounge on the end of it. We had to put it next to a wall to get it to fit, which means we could not put an end table there. This tray worked perfectly. Well made and sturdy. I love the spring loaded legs. Keeps things in place. It’s a great size too. Would definitely recommend.

Review: Solidly built of quality materials. Good attention to detail... strong hinges and thin non-slip rubber pads on the underside of the tray and insides of the "legs" keep the tray secure on the arm of the couch. Stable and sturdy, doesn't wiggle or wobble. Photos are of the "Acacia Wood Light" color. Our overhead light made the wood look a bit lighter in the photos than it is in person, so I also included a photo with the light off to try to capture a more accurate color for the wood. Better looking and better quality than I expected. I originally thought it was a bit expensive for a simple wooden tray, but it's totally worth the $35.

Review: It grips the chair arm well and is stable. It remains level and is strong enough to support a full glass.In my case, it takes up horizontal space. As an 86 year old, I need both arms to get up. The table does get in the way and has to be removed to accomplish this.So, well made, but present a partial problem.The light color is pleasant, it is easy to attach and does what is designed for.

Review: Best purchase ever for my fellow couch-easters! Saves space and it is so sturdy and easy to move to a different area/arm of a couch. Highly recommend!

Review: I have a leather couch with fairly slim armrests. They fit perfectly! The “clamps” are lightly padded— no destruction to my couch. They are also secure!  I slip them under the couch for easy access too. Highly recommend!!

Review: I love this, I needed a side table on my couch, I did not have the space and this was a great option. I use it mostly for a drink, remotes, even snack or meal plate. It grips great and comes in different colors. It’s very sturdy and the springs on the joints help it adjust to the size of your couch/chair size.

Review: Fits a couch back and a large chair securely. Cushioned arms provide good grip that hasn’t scuffed up the leather. Sturdy enough for a hot cup of tea :)

Review: Das Teil sieht gut aus und macht einen hochwertigen, stabilen Eindruck. Die Federn in den Scharnieren halten das Tablett sicher auf der Armlehne der Couch. In meinem Fall hat die Lehne ca 31cm, was ich als Obergrenze bezeichnen würde.
