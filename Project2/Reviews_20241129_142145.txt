Review: These are slim, durable and do an amazing job of protecting the phone. I have had one of these commuter cases specifically on my phones for over 10 years. My last phone was 4 years old and after taking it out of the case after I got a new phone, the old phone still looked perfect. These cases even held up on my daughters phone and kids are really tough on them! Easy to hold and the buttons work perfectly. Pop sockets stick to them also if you like to add them.

Review: This is my second Otter box which kept my Apple iPhone 7 in perfect condition. Even after upgrading, the case was trashed but the phone is perfecto. So when I upgraded to a knew iPhone I did not hesitate in purchasing the otter box. The grip is great for me, the case fits like a glove and seems more durable than the last case I had.

Review: Been using this style case on the last 3 iPhones. Grippy enough to hang onto with good drop protection. The flap over the charging port requires 2 hands to plug in (annoying if driving and navigating alone), but it keeps dust and dirt out of the port which can lead to more serious problems.

Review: So this did fit on my husband’s phone. It looks nice and the quality is great. He just was not happy with how slippery it was. His old case was more like rubber and his grip with his hand would hold onto it better so he switched back, but this is a great price and good quality phone case.

Review: I accidentally got this version despite having an iPhone 15 and it still fits great! Super easy to install, the only issue being the camera cutout, but it’s still in a place that doesn’t cover anything so it works. The case is textured which makes it easy to hold and comfortable since you don’t have to worry about it slipping, even when holding loosely. Obviously I would prefer to have a case made specifically for my phone, but I can’t really complain with this either! Great case.

Review: Slim and durable, love the texture so it’s still grippy and not too slippery, looks nice and love that the space for the charging cord can be covered when not using to keep it clear from any dust. Overall, very happy with it, especially knowing it will be better protected from falls.

Review: My spouse drops her phone often, I don’t know why or how but it just happens, often. The phone was dropped once already while we were waiting for the Ottorbox to arrive via Amazon overnight.  The Ottorbox has always worked in the past so it was a no brainer when she received her new phone. This model is no different with the same level of quality we’ve come to expect from past experiences.  She likes this one because it’s a good balance of drop protection material while being lightweight and low profile. The camera lenses are well protected and are at a lower plane than the case.  At first she didn’t like the higher lip around the edge of the case as she felt it each time she swiped up from the home button however she got used to it after a couple of days. The case looks good and feels good in hand.
